# Recent Sublime Text 3 Projects

This action allows you to browse and launch recently opened Sublime Text 3 
projects. To use the action use:

1. Trigger LaunchBar
2. Navigate to the Sublime Text application.
3. Press right-arrow to list recently opened projects.
4. Press enter to launch the project.

The action enumerates recently opened projects listed in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Local/Session.sublime_session`.  This list is populated by Sublime Text 3 after closing.  So a newly opened project will not appear in this list until after Sublime Text 3 has been quit.
